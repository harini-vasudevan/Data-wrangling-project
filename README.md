Deadliest Atlantic hurricane & landfall on Puerto Rico.
On September 20, 2017, Hurricane María made landfall on Puerto Rico. It was the worst natural disaster on record in Puerto Rico and the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since 2004. However, Puerto Rico's official death statistics only tallied 64 deaths caused directly by the hurricane (due to structural collapse, debris, floods and drownings), an undercount that slowed disaster recovery funding. The majority of the deaths resulted from infrastructure damage that made it difficult to access resources like clean food, water, power, healthcare and communications in the months after the disaster, and although these deaths were due to effects of the hurricane, they were not initially counted.
We will use data wrangling skills to extract actual daily mortality data from Puerto Rico and investigate whether the Hurricane María had an immediate effect on daily mortality compared to unaffected days in September 2015-2017.
The following points have been noticed in actual daily mortality data from Puerto Rico.
1.September 2015 and 2016 deaths by day are roughly equal to each other.
2.After the hurricane in September 2017, there were over 100 deaths per day every day for the rest of the month.
3.No days before September 20, 2017 have over 100 deaths per day.
